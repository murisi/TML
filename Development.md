# Outputs

`output` is a class wrapping an output stream from TML. It allows to
redirect each of the TML outputs to stdout, stderr, a file, a string
buffer (for reading it later programatically) or to a null.
Outputs are usually configured (targeted) by `options` class.

## creating a new output

Use method `shared_ptr<output> output::create(std::wstring name, std::wstring
target, std::wstring extension);` where all arguments are wstrings.

## targets of outputs

Possible targets are:
- @null
- @stdout
- @stderr
- @buffer
- filename - any string not matching any of above names

## outputs container

There is a container structure for `output` objects.
Pointer to this container is passed to the `options` object which configures the
outputs. Name of the output is matched when a STRING option with the same name
is parsed. More details for configuring outputs see bellow in the *Options*
section.


## default outputs

After creating `outputs` object. You can call its method `init_defaults()` to
create default outputs.

Default outputs are:

|             |                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| output      | default output for TML print builtins             |
| error       | error messages                                    |
| info        | info messages                                     |
| debug       | debug messages (requires Debug build)             |
| dump        | database dump                                     |
| benchmarks  | measured benchmarks                               |
| transformed | transformed program                               |
| repl-output | repl                                              |
| xsb         | program translated into XSB                       |
| swipl       | program translated into SWIPL                     |
| souffle     | program translated into Souffl√©                   |


`outputs` object acts also as a global container. It is possible to use multiple
outputs objects for example when you need to use multiple drivers at the same
time. Switch between `outputs` objects by calling `outputs::use()` or
`o::use(const outputs&)` method.

Example:
```
	outputs oo;
	oo.init_defaults();
	oo.use();
```
This is required when using multiple `outputs` objects.
If there is only a single `outputs` container used in the whole program, calling
`init_defaults()` and `use()` is not necessary since first such object ever
instantiated calls these two methods automatically. It is enough to use just:
```
	outputs oo;
```

## adding new output

Adding new output is possible with calling `outputs::add(shared_ptr<output>)`
or directly: `outputs::add(output::create(name, target, extension))`

## **o** namespace

There is a namespace `o`  to allow quick access to global streams (global
`outputs` object is the first such object or the one which was set global by
calling `outputs::use()`).

For convenience there are methods with quick access to configured wostreams:
- `o::out()`
- `o::err()`
- `o::inf()`
- `o::dbg()`
- `o::repl()`,
- `o::ms()` - this is for **benchmarks** output
- `o::dump()`

There is also `o::to(const std::wstring&)` to get output's wostream by its name.


# Options

There is an `options` class which is used to pass and parse options for
a TML driver. Its constructor or parse function can take parameters with
`int argc/char* argv`, `strings args` or `wstrings args` API.

If you need `options` to configure `outputs`, use a pointer to the container
in constructor or call `set_outputs(outputs*)` before calling `parse()`.

Example:
```
	outputs oo;
	options opts(&oo, argc, argv);
	driver d(opts);
```
or:
```
	std::vectors<std::string>args{ "--no-dump","--transformed","@stdout" };
	outputs oo;
	driver d(options(&oo, args));
```

## reading options

`options` object has methods for reading values: `enabled()`, `disabled()`,
`get_bool()`, `get_int()`, `get_string()`. All take `const wstring& option_name`
as an argument.

Example:
```
	if (o.enabled(L"help")) help();
	else d.run(o.get_int(L"steps));
```

## available options

Run `tml --help` (or `options::help(const wostream&)` programatically) to see
a help generated from all available options and their descriptions.


## adding a new option

Add a new option in the method `void options::setup()`. See its content for
examples.
There is a function `add` adding an option defined by type, names (alternative
names) and a lambda function (event) called when the option is present/parsed.
There are helper macros `add_bool`, `add_output` for adding bool options and
outputs.

Use `option::description(const std::wstring&)` setter for adding a description
text. The text is used for the generated help.

### option types

There are currently three different types for options
- INT (uses result of std::stoi(arg))
- BOOL (true if arg is one of "", "true", "t", "1", "on", "enabled", "yes"
	false if arg is one of "false", "f", "0", "off", "disbled", "no")
- STRING (any value basically)

### output option

Outputs are not special types. They use STRING type. Output name is also the
name of the option which is used to configure output's target.

Use: `--OUTPUT_NAME @target`.

### default value for an option

Best place to add a default value for an option is in a method `void
options::init_defaults()`.

### negating/disabling options

bool options and output options can be negated by adding `disable-`, `no-` or
`dont-` prefix to the option name. Example:
```
  tml --dont-run --no-dump --disable-debug
```


# Driver

`driver` class manages execution of TML programs.

Before running a TML program we need to create an outputs object which contains
output streams.
Then we have various ways to instantiate a driver object.
We can provide a TML program as a string, as a FILE stream and/or we can also
use options object and specify any option including input programs.
Options object parses arguments and configures streams in the outputs
object.

For execution there are two methods
`step(size_t steps = 1, size_t break_on_step=0, bool break_on_FP = false)` or
`run(size_t steps = 0, size_t break_on_step=0, bool break_on_FP = false)`
0 steps means infinite number of steps and 0 break_on_step means to not break

Example:
```
	outputs oo;
	wstring program = L"a(2). b(?x) :- a(?x).";
	vector<wstring> args{
		L"--dump", "@buffer",
		L"--error", "@buffer" };
	driver d(program, options(&oo, args));
	d.run();
	if (d.result) d.dump();
	else wcout << L"unsat";
	wstring err = oo.read(L"error");
	if (err.size()) wcerr << err;
	wstring dump = oo.read(L"dump");
	if (dump.size()) wcout << dump;
```

To extract result there are several functions:
`driver::dump()` prints database to the "dump" output
`driver::out(wostream&)` prints database to a stream
`driver::out_goals(wostream&)` prints extracted proofs

It is also possible to pass a custom raw term printer:
`driver::out(const tables::rt_printer& p)` which gets called for each printed term.

See actual usage of `driver` in `src/main.cpp` and `src/repl.cpp`

## Quote

The quote transformation takes a string representing a TML program and stores its syntax tree in a relation of the given name. The encoding of the tree into a relation is done as follows: each node in the tree is represented by a tuple in the quotation in the relation. The amount of information stored in each tuple varies depending on the node type, but the following information is always included: a node ID which is a symbol that uniquely identifies the encoded node, and a node type which is a symbol that must come from the set of supported node types. If a given tuple does not represent a leaf node in the syntax tree, then it may contain one or more IDs pointing to the tuples representing the child nodes.

Suppose that a string representing a program written in a simplified subset of TML were quoted into a relation `q`. The following specification shows how `q` might be structured:
```
q(VARS <id>)
q(RULE <id> <head id> <body id>).
q(TERM <id> <name>).
q(TERM <id> <name> <param1 id>).
q(TERM <id> <name> <param1 id> <param2 id>).
q(TERM <id> <name> <param1 id> <param2 id> <param3 id>).
q(TERM <id> <name> <param1 id> <param2 id> <param3 id> <param4 id>).
q(EQUALS <id> <param1 name> <param2 name>).
q(FORALL <id> <var name> <body id>).
q(EXISTS <id> <var name> <body id>).
q(NOT <id> <body id>).
q(AND <id> <body1 id> <body2 id>).
q(OR <id> <body1 id> <body2 id>).
```
As can be seen the node type is encoded in first position, the node ID in second position, and the remaining slots are filled with information specific to the type of node. It might not make sense to put certain node types in certain positions (i.e. a universal quantifier inside a term), so TML's grammer must be referred to in order to produce quotation relations that can be understood by other TML constructs like `eval`. Here we could have had a specific node type for symbols, but here it suffices to check whether a node is not a variable.

Now we give a concrete usage of quote and show how the quote transformation transforms it. The following input:
```
eval(a 2 q`
  r(1 2).
  r(2 3).
  r(3 4).
  t(?x ?y) :- r(?x ?y).`).
```
Gets transformed into:
```
eval(a 2 q).
q(EQUALS 0f20 0 0).
q(TERM 0f30 r 1 2).
q(RULE 0f40 0f30 0f20).
q(EQUALS 0f60 0 0).
q(TERM 0f70 r 2 3).
q(RULE 0f80 0f70 0f60).
q(EQUALS 0f100 0 0).
q(TERM 0f110 r 3 4).
q(RULE 0f120 0f110 0f100).
q(TERM 0f140 r 0f150 0f160).
q(TERM 0f170 t 0f150 0f160).
q(RULE 0f180 0f170 0f140).
q(VARS 0f150).
q(VARS 0f160).
```

## This

The `this` transformation happens just before the TML program optimizations begin. It is essentially a call to the quote transformation applied to the entire TML program with the output relation fixed to the name `this`. (Note that `this` will not contain a `this` relation if the TML program itself does not contain one.) If there are TML quotations or interpreters in the TML program, they too will be captured in the `this` relation. Though this means that a TML program can refer to and partially interpret itself, this mechanism is limited by `eval` 's preconditions.

What follows is a TML program that checks itself for a conjunction:
```
has_a_conjunction :- this(AND ?x ?y ?z).
```
Gets transformed into:
```
has_a_conjunction() :- this(AND ?x ?y ?z).
this(TERM 0f20 this AND 0f30 0f40 0f50).
this(TERM 0f60 has_a_conjunction).
this(RULE 0f70 0f60 0f20).
this(VARS 0f30).
this(VARS 0f40).
this(VARS 0f50).
```

## Eval

The `eval` transformation takes a symbol referring to a (defined or undefined) relation containing a quotation and an interpreter size, and creates an interpreter in the relation of the given name. The interpreter derives the same tuples as would have been derived by the quoted rules it evaluates except that each tuple is prepended with a label specifying the name of the deriving quoted rule. That is, if the interpreter is housed in a relation `q` and it is interpreting a quoted rule `r` that would have derived `r(1 2 3)`, then the interpreter derives `q(r 1 2 3)`. The interpreter comprises two parts: one to execute parts of the syntax tree and another to writeback the results into the interpreter relation.

There is an executor for each type of node that can occur in the body of a rule. Its job is to derive a term containing the node ID of the current node if executing it yields `true`. Every executor has contains a term to capture the parts of the node type it matches; this might be a term name or conjunct IDs. Every executor also exports all the symbols/variables used by the current node and its descendents; this is necessary since any element could potentially be a variable that is referred to somewhere else in the syntax tree. If the node type is simply a term of a given arity, then the executor simply ensures that the interpreter relation has derived a term of the same name and arity. (Note the recursion as the executor is also being referred to by the interpreter rules.) If the node type is a compound like a conjunction, then the executor would instead use the executor relation to execute the child nodes and then use the corresponding host language operator (i.e. `&&`) to combine the results.

Here is an executor for nodes of type `OR`:
```
aux(?id ?a1 ?b1 ?a2 ?b2 ?a3 ?b3 ?a4 ?b4) :-
  q(OR ?id ?e1 ?e2) &&
  {aux(?e1 ?a2 ?b2 ?a3 ?b3 ?a4 ?b4 -1 -1) ||
  aux(?e2 ?a1 ?b1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1)} &&
  {fv(?a2 ?b2 ?a1 ?b1) && fv(?a3 ?b3 ?a1 ?b1) && fv(?a4 ?b4 ?a1 ?b1)}.
```
The second line is the capturing term described earlier. Note the `?id` term, it represents the ID of the node being interpreted. Note the `OR` in the capture term, it ensures that this rule only executes `OR` nodes. Since the result of an `OR` expression is determined by its child nodes, the executor calls itself on the IDs of its child nodes. The variables coming after the IDs in the subcalls are the exported elements that were described earlier; we need these exports in case, for example, the child nodes constrain a common variable. Note that the exports are done in pairs; this is because we need to export both the variable names (so that we know what values we need to constrain to be the same) and their values (so that we can actually simulate the computations that would happen were the node not quoted.) Note the `||` sign, this is because we are using the host interpreter's facilities to implement the guest interpreter's facilities. The `fv`'s and `fs`'s implement variable value constraints through modus ponens.

There is also a writeback for each rule arity and sign (i.e. insertion or deletion). Its job is to to call the executor on the rule's body node, select the elements required for the head and label them as described earlier. Every writeback rule contains a term to capture a rule and head nodes, from which it obtains the head name and the body term ID. All writeback rules also contain a term to call the executor on the body and capture the variables computed in the body's execution. And lastly, all writeback rules contain a group of terms to correctly fix the head variables to the variables exported from the execution of the body. To interpret a deletion rule, one could negate the head of the writeback rule and make the body only capture head nodes of type `NOT` instead of `NOT`.

Here is an example of a writeback rule for nodes representing arity 1 rules:
```
r(?nm ?d1) :-
  q(RULE ?id ?e0 ?e1) &&
  q(TERM ?e0 ?nm ?c1) &&
  aux(?e1 ?a1 ?b1 ?a2 ?b2 ?a3 ?b3 ?a4 ?b4) &&
  fs(?c1 ?d1) &&
  fv(?a1 ?b1 ?c1 ?d1) && ... && fv(?a4 ?b4 ?c1 ?d1).
```

An interpreter size of `N` ensures that the interpreter produced supports up to `N` distinct variables in quoted rule heads and up to `N` distinct variables in quoted rule bodies. This support is achieved by varying the number of variables exported by each executor rule. Without this variable propagation, the interpreter would be smaller but would not be able to correctly handle the same variable being used in different quoted terms of the same quoted rules. Applying an interpreter to rules exceeding the interpreter size will in general lead to correct results because the executors and the writeback rules will fail to capture and hence execute the quoted syntax nodes.

## Sequencing

The sequencing transformation takes an unsequenced transformation (i.e. a transformation that would be correct if rules instead behaved like macros) and turns it into a sequenced transformation (i.e. a transformation that would be correct if macros instead behaved like rules). The overall idea behind this transformation is to version the relations so that so that the pre-update version has a different name to the post-update version, apply the unsequenced transformation, topologically sort the rules to establish an execution order (of rule sets) that produces the results intended by the unsequenced transformation, and then output these rules with markers indicating relative execution order along with writeback rules to make the post-update relations the new pre-update relations.

It is easiest to understand this transformation through an example. Imagine that we would like to "factorize" the following program:
```
car(?x ?y) :- car(?x ?y), truck(?y ?x).
truck(?x ?y) :- car(?y ?x), truck(?x ?y).
```
Naively replacing 2nd relation with `truck(?x ?y) :- car(?y ?x).` would be incorrect due to staging and mutation of car relation. I.e. even if the `truck` relation obtained the right facts, they would come delayed with respect to the facts in the `car` relation. What we need is for the `car` and `truck` relations to have the correct facts simultaneously. So let us version the relations as follows: `0f10` is car's update and `0f20` is truck's update.
```
0f10(?x ?y) :- car(?x ?y), truck(?y ?x).
0f20(?x ?y) :- car(?y ?x), truck(?x ?y).
```
Now their relative execution order is inconsequential since the rules are independent of each other. The rules can now be treated like macros and be substituted or exapnded freely by any transformation as can be seen in the following:
```
0f10(?x ?y) :- car(?x ?y), truck(?y ?x).
0f20(?x ?y) :- 0f10(?y ?x).
```
Now a topological sort can be used to establish that rule `0f10` should fire before rule `0f20` if their corresponding relations are to contain the updates of `car` and `truck` respectively. After we put in writeback rules to synchronize the original relations with their updates, we should obtain a program that looks as follows:
```
Stage 0:
	0f10(?x ?y) :- car(?x ?y), truck(?y ?x).
Stage 1:
	0f20(?x ?y) :- 0f10(?y ?x).
Stage 2:
	car(?x ?y) :- 0f10(?x ?y).
	truck(?x ?y) :- 0f20(?x ?y).
	~0f10(?x ?y) :- 0f10(?x ?y).
	~0f20(?x ?y) :- 0f20(?x ?y).
```
Note the two deletion rules in stage 2; these are done to prevent the temporary "version" relations from a previous stage from affecting the execution of future stages. The last program above is only pseudo-code, in actuallity the staging would be done by conditioning each of these rules upon the stages of some clock construction.

## Purification

The purification transformation converts TML rules written in first-order logic syntax to (possibly more) rules that are conjunctions of possibly negated negated terms. This is an unsequenced transformation, meaning that the rules that it creates should be treated like macros when reasoning about execution ordering. The transformation works its way up the syntax tree of a first-order logic formula doing the following conversions:

### Conjunction
Handled by creating a new relation whose defining rule has multiple conjuncts.
```
r(...) :- ... { a(?x ?z) && b(?y ?z) } ...
TO
c(?x ?y ?z) :- a(?x ?z), b(?y ?z).
r(...) :- ... c(?x ?y ?z) ...
```

### Disjunction
Handled by creating a new relation whose defining rule has multiple clauses.
```
r(...) :- ... { a(?x ?z) || b(?y ?z) } ...
TO
c(?x ?y ?z) :- a(?x ?z).
c(?x ?y ?z) :- b(?y ?z).
r(...) :- ... c(?x ?y ?z) ...
```

### Negation
Handled by factoring the negation into a separate rule.
```
r(...) :- ... { ~ a(?x ?z) } ...
TO
c(?x ?z) :- ~a(?x ?z).
r(...) :- ... c(?x ?z) ...
```

### Implication
Handled by reduction to negation and disjunction.
```
r(...) :- ... { a(?x ?z) -> b(?y ?z) } ...
TO
r(...) :- ... { { ~ a(?x ?z) } || b(?y ?z) } ...
```

### Coimplication
Handled by reduction to conjunction of implications.
```
r(...) :- ... { a(?x ?z) <-> b(?y ?z) } ...
TO
r(...) :- ... { { a(?x ?z) -> b(?y ?z) } && { b(?y ?z) -> a(?x ?z) } } ...
```

### Existential Quantification
Handled by creating a separate rule in which the quantified variable is free. The solver will find the correct variable assignments if they exist.
```
r(...) :- ... exists ?x { a(?x ?y) } ...
TO
c(?y) :- a(?x ?y).
r(...) :- ... c(?y) ...
```
### Universal Quantification
Handled by reduction to the lack of existence of an object that does not satisfy the given property.
```
r(...) :- ... forall ?x { a(?x ?y) } ...
TO
r(...) :- ... ~ { exists ?x { ~ a(?x ?y) } } ...
```
### Uniqueness Quantification
Handled by reduction to universal and existential quantification and a coimplication.
```
r(...) :- ... unique ?x { a(?x ?y) } ...
TO
r(...) :- ... exists ?u { forall ?x { { ?u = ?x } <-> a(?x ?y) } } ...
```


# JS (emscripten) build

There is an emscripten binding allowing TML run in browsers or with Node.js.
Enable the JS build with `-DBUILD_JSLIB=1 -DEMSCRIPTEN_DIR=/path/to/emscripten`

See example usage of JS `driver` in `js/test.html` and `js/tmljs` (Node.js)


# REPL

TML executable can be run in a REPL mode. Enable it with `--repl` option.
REPL mode depends on a TML build configured with `-DWITH_THREADS=TRUE`.

After running `tml --repl` enter `q` to quit, `?` or `h` to print help about
other commands, or enter TML program to evaluate.

REPL can also work over an UDP. Enable it with `--udp` option.
You can specify IP address and port by using `--udp-addr` and `--udp-port`.
Settings default to `127.0.0.1:6283`.
